A movie recommendation system using Neo4j and python, which can create a list of movies that the user might actually like.
Neo4j is a graph database that can be used to store and query data.
In this project, we will use Neo4j to store information about movies and connect movies with each other using their similarity score. 
We will also use python to create a script that will recommend movies to the user.
